						<h2>WLG to SFO</h2>
						<p>24 March 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>Timezones are awesome. I landed in SFO on a Monday morning 11am, 13 actual hours after leaving Wellington but 6 hours earlier than boarding the plane in Wellington (Monday 5pm). Probably the longest day I've ever had. Throw in a hour long
					queue and I was ready for the hostel.</p>

		<img class="lazy" data-original="assets/2014/IMG_0416.JPG" width="600" height="224">

					<p>I caused an annoyance through customs by not having an definite outline for my trip, not having my outgoing ticket in analog form (couldn't pull out my phone at customs) and they also couldn't understand the concept of credit cards so only having $100USD on me for 40 days raised their concerns.</p>

						<h2>San Francisco</h2>
						<p>24th March 2014 (again)</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>Our first day in SF was very much about getting bearings and working out the city. Our accommodation was the <a href="http://www.sanfranhostel.com/">San Francisco International Hostel</a>. Conveniently located a block from Union Square and a BART station from the Airport it turned out to be an ideal location for pricey sum of $25 USD a night.</p>

						<img class="lazy right" data-original="assets/2014/DSC_0004.jpg" width="200" height="460" />
					</div>

					<p>After dropping the bags off, a walk was called for to stretch the legs. While walking around the city and down to the Ferry Building it was the first big culture shock to notice the number of beggars and other homeless, street people trying to hussle for cash.</p>

					<p>Coming from Wellington where we like our street people discrete and docile, these ones were defiantly much more outgoing (and occasionally entertaining), even worst than Thailand or Malaysia.</p> 

					<p>To compound the culture shock our first stop off the Airport BART was Powell St station. A tourist spot that must attract certain enterprising individuals as well as an aroma more potent than any reggae concert I've been too. Despite the attention, most were charming and helpful (probably for a bigger tip) but when you're a tourist with a wallet full of only $50/$100 notes it makes you a popular person. <strong>Tip:</strong> At airport get change. Keep your change in another location to your larger bills.</p>

					<div class="imagelist">
						<img class="lazy" data-original="assets/2014/DSC_0001.jpg" width="600" height="727" />
					</div>

					<p>The weather was nice enough to walk around in shorts but it turns out San Francisco is analogous to Wellington in terms of fickle weather patterns. As soon as the sun peaked out and temperatures rose for a second, the weather would pack up. With that knowledge after day 1, I made sure I always had the jacket and sweatshirt packed while walking around.</p>

					<p>Our tour of Alcatraz was a great example, the entire day alternated between stinking hot sun and frigid sea breezes. Lucky enough the rain would disappear long enough to get a few photos without getting soaked (unlike the boat ride out.</p>

					<p>The weather did play a bit of a havoc with getting around since walking is usually my preferred method of transport while learning a city. Fortunately enough a pub was always within reach when a storm needed to pass. San Francisco was a perfect city for navigating around on foot and never got lost trying to get back to the hostel at Union Square.</p>

					<p>Throughout this trip the accommodation type of choice would be and is hostels. Not just to keep the cost of 87 nights of costs down ($30 a night in most hostels vs $100+ in a motel) but hostels tend to have more like minded travelers and shared living spaces to met new people. In our first hostel for example we teamed us with a bunch of Americas (ah, spring break), 2 dutch girls, a German and another Kiwi and hit the Karaoke bar.</p>

					<p>Next day we all did our own thing, for us, we went for the bus trip over the Golden Gate bridge to Sausalito. The organized CitySighting tour is highly recommended the trip over the bridge and neighboring tour lasted about 2 hours. The driver was filled with local knowledge, advice and well worth the tour (which I'm normally skeptical about). That evening we hit up the AT&amp;T stadium for my first ever live baseball match between the Giants and Oakland A's. Great stadium atmosphere let down somewhat by the expensive ($10.99) beers when you're been driving at $3/bottle pubs before hand!</p>

					<p>All up with spent 5 days and 4 nights in San Francisco, in hindsight, I could have probably filled up another 3 days easily exploring more of the area outside of downtown and partying with our spring break travelers. San Francisco is a city I would want to put a few months into to really get around to see the sights.</p>

						<h2>Heading south.</h2>
						<p>March 28th 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>After our time in San Francisco we had to pick up the rental car and head south. The rental car company was a tiny little outfit located south of the Airport (10 minutes) in San Mateo but once we found that and organized the paperwork for the beast of a 2010 Toyota Corolla it was to In-And-Out Burger (I wish we had these in NZ) and then onto the 101 south to San Jose and then the 17 out to Santa Cruz. From there we would meet up with the Pacific Coast highway.</p>

					<p>From Monterey south down the coast it was beautiful, rugged, raw terrain. As this is a fairly remote road, most if not all traffic appeared to be tourist vehicles. The driving pace was relaxed, sun was out and the road has dozens of well utilized photo vista opportunities all the way along.</p>

					<p>After about 4 hours driving (and the same amount of time swooning over the views) we stopped for the night in San Simeon near Hearst Castle. A odd small town which appeared to be based around accommodation just for the tourist trade I think a better way to do this coast would be to grab a tent and make the most of the vistas. We passed several stunning campgrounds based right on the coast which would have blown my mind to wake up in but not this time. We also completely skipped the Big Sur walks. Got to leave something for next time.</p>

					<p>The next day we continued down the coast early, getting in amazing smoked fish tacos at Cayucos and then continuing on the 1. We bypassed Santa Maria and our next stop was Santa Barbara. A classy shopping district, it seemed a bit ritzy for us. Took in the pier then headed towards our next stop Venice Beach.</p>

						<h2 id="venice">Venice Beach.</h2>
						<p>March 30th 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>Center of counter-culture and home to some of the more colorful walks of life, Venice beach was buzzing everyday, all day we were in town. Luckily, our <a href="http://www.planetvenice.com/">hostel</a> was a block away from the main action and noise. With over 3 miles of boardwalk, stalls and several piers to checkout we cruised up and down the beach to Santa Monica and down to Marina Del Ray several times to take in the sights. Thoughout each journey enjoying cheap happy hour drinks ($2-$3) still while watching the sun go down. Drinks, sun and having buskers rocking out decent blues music is one way to make me quite content I've come to realize. Venice turned out to be the perfect place to just sit, read and slow down before heading right into L.A. </p>

						<h2 id="hollywood">Hollywood.</h2>
						<p>April 2nd 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>Before I got absorbed into the beach and threw away everything other than my board shorts we fought the traffic to head to our next <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hollywood-Youth-Hostel/Los-Angeles/32211">hostel</a> right on Hollywood Blvd. Middle of town, right on the subway route and in the thick of Hollywood culture. Sitting atop Hollyword Blvd and looking down the walk of frame gave a totally different vibe to from the coast and Venice beach. What I did love about our new hostel was that the first floor common room opened up above the main Hollywood Blvd (with a view of the Dolby Theater) which let the sounds and smells in of the strip while providing a great couch to sit and catch up with emails.</p>

					<p>While in Hollywood we checked out Universal Studios - a easy trip via train from Hollywood and Highlands. We easily spent the whole day out there with the tour of the studio and doing a couple of rides on offer (some are more designed for 5-14 age groups than adults. The renowned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_The_Ride#Universal_Studios_Hollywood">Transformers</a> ride is easily the most immerse experience I've gone through in a ride and worth going to Universal in itself.</p>

					<p>The closest we got to heading into downtown L.A from Hollywood was the night we the 3rd when we went into the Lakers vs Trailblazers NBA match at the impressive Staples Center. The whole environment around the stadium, concourse and surrounding L.A Live was impressive and defiantly a good example for a full match day experience the rest of the world could emulate. The game itself was one sided (Trailblazers walked away with the victory) the experience of my first NBA game will be unforgetable. That included being less than a meter away from the legendary Kareem Abdul Jabeer while he walked to the V.I.P seats.</p>

					<p>Since shopping on Rodeo drive or Star hunting the Hollywood Hills didn't really interest us as two young males, and on a tip from another traveler at the hostel (Fellow kiwi again no less) we opted for a hike up through <a href="http://www.laparks.org/dos/parks/facility/runyoncanyonpk.html">Runyon Canyon</a> and got off a couple of good shots of L.A on an unusually clear LA day at the top of the hill.</p>

						<h2 id="road-again">On the road again.</h2>
						<p>April 6th 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>After pulling a swift slight of hand to the parking attendant to avoid the $85 parking bill, we left Hollywood bound for San Diego along the I-5. The scale of LA doesn't hit home till you see all their freeways.</p>

					<p>It's a city designed around cars, roads and urban sprawl. Despite the number of freeways and the fact we left a 11AM we still had standstill (peak?) traffic for the first 40km of traveling down through the city. Once we hit south of L.A. traffic still stubbornly remained heavy. At Oceanside we decided to pull over, gas up and check out the beach for lunch.</p>

					<p>From Oceanside we decided to skip rejoining the I-5 and stick with Coast Highway 101 which runs in parallel. As it's a local road, the road has a lower speed limit and the occasional traffic light so one can spend more time looking at the scenery. The road took us along the coast past the famous Torrey Pines State National Reserve and the golf course back onto the I-5 freeway. From there it was a straight easy drive into Downtown San Diego. Unlike L.A. however, the city was basically void of traffic for a mid afternoon Sunday and simple to navigate around.</p>

						<h2 id="san-diego">San Diego.</h2>
						<p>April 6th 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>For picking accommodation in San Diego we had two contenders. Ocean Beach had several highly rated hostels and was near the beach and option two was downtown, which had half a dozen hostels. We opted for downtown which turned out to be the right call. Staying at the <a href="http://usahostels.com">USA Hostel San Diego</a> on fifth ave, middle of the historic Gaslamp District in San Diego, I could not recommend the location and the hostel organization / step any higher.</p>

					<p>We were told that San Diego is a good city for drinking in and we weren't disappointed. The Gaslamp District was jam packed full of bars, pubs, craft breweries and night clubs. Several nights in the hostel, they organized pub crawls which was a great way to checkout some random little spots.</p>

					<p>It wasn't always drinking and parties while we were there, we also hit up the world famous San Diego Zoo and the <a href="http://www.midway.org/">USS Midway Aircraft carrier</a> and a couple day trips up north to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jolla">La Jolla</a> and the <a href="http://www.sdzsafaripark.org/">Safari Park</a>.</p>

				<p>If you make it as far south as San Diego, it'll be rude to not make the 15 mile trip by train to the border and say you've been to Mexico. We did an organized tour with the hostel guests. An eccentric bunch of people we managed to have a decent enough time in trying conditions (massive queues, delays). Food was amazing (at least for those who ordered) and drinks were cheapish (as you would expect). <strong>Tip:</strong> stick to beer, you couldn't help but notice how little alcohol was in the cocktails and generally everyone in the group felt jipped.</p>

				<p>I don't think I would bother with Tijuana again.</p>

					<p>Lack of alcohol in the cocktails from last night had one distinct benefit in that it made getting up at 10 am for the drive up to Vegas significantly less of a issue. We headed straight up to Vegas and admired the amazing vast scenery and emptiness on the freeway heading into Vegas.</p>

					</hgroup>

					<p>We stayed 3 nights at the MGM owned <a href="http://www.excalibur.com">Excalibur</a> hotel and casino. Defiantly not the best hotel in Vegas but for the pricey sum of $35USD a night it was a steal for a location on the strip and across the road from the MGM Grand and New York, New York. From there we managed to check out the sights and throw down a few coin at the Blackjack tables. <strong>Tip</strong>: There was a correlation between my success at the tables and the amount I tipped the dealer. Read into that what you will but the dealer can be the best player on the table.</p>

					<p>Next door to the Excalibur in the Luxor, got to check out Criss Angel live show <a href="http://www.luxor.com/entertainment/entertainment_believe.aspx">Believe</a>. I'm a bit of a skeptic generally but Criss and the crew put on a impressive show.</p>

					<p>While the rental car couldn't head out of state, we at least took it to the Arizona border to check out the Hoover dam (about 45 minutes out of Vegas).</p>

						<h2 id="coachella">Coachella.</h2>
						<p>April 18th 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p><a href="http://www.coachella.com/home/">Coachella</a> is one of the largest, most famous, and (sadly) most profitable music festivals in the United States. 3 days of music, sun, sweat and partying. Based on recommendations from other young travelers we opted for camping at <a href="http://www.shadowhillsrvresort.com">Shadow Hills RV Resort</a> along with 1300 other people. As I don't carry a tent while traveling, all that was needed quick stop at Walmart and for the pricey sum of $100 all up we were kitted out with tents, air mattresses, Chilly bin (or in Yank terms a Cooler). The bare minimum to survive on 4 days in the desert.</p>

					<p>I can't speak highly enough of the Shadow Hills setup and would recommend them again in a heart beat for young travelers heading to Coachella. We got to the camp side early to get good spot. Thankfully we arrived in time to get a spot near shade at the front of the park rather than out in the exposed field of tents. Tent spots were tight and if you're a privacy fan you may need to check that at the gate. Once setup the atmosphere and the attitude of everyone around was super kind and easy going. While 1,300 drinking, tired, sweaty young people could turn out for the worst everybody I met seemed to be considerate, helpful and genuinely interesting people who were good value.</p> 

					<p>One of the selling points of the RV resort was the fact that it has a direct shuttle service with the festival (about a 30 minute drive). Shuttles ran every ~15 minutes all day. Due to the heat, we tended to stick around the pool and party till mid afternoon before heading into the festival till late.</p>

					<p>I've had the pleasure of attending a few festivals in NZ but neither have compared to the scale or level of organization of Coachella. They've had a dozen or so years to get the recipe right and I think it showed.</p>

					<p>Top two highlights music wise for me include Bastile, Outkast on Friday, Queens of the Stone Age, Nas on Saturday and Rudimential, Lana Del Ray on the Sunday. This was also my first time seeing two of my favourite New Zealand acts - Lorde and The Naked and Famous. Both played good sets and did the Kiwi flags in the crowd proud.</p>

					<p>It's at this point I wave goodbye to the West Coast of the USA and fly out of SFO after a month. Delivered the rental car back in one piece. Hat's off to <a href="http://www.supercheapcar.com">Super Cheap Car Rental</a> for the ride. Saved us an arm and a leg over the main suppliers and friendly service as well. We finished up on 1949 miles driven (thank god for unlimited miles) so made good value of the car. Feeling really disappointed to leave the sun (we've had 3 weeks without seeing rain once) and go back into a city like New York but on we must go.</p>

						<p>April 24rd 2014</p>
					</hgroup>

					<p>The accommodation for New York was the new <a href="http://thelocalny.com/">The Local</a> hostel based in Long Island City rather than Manhattan. Turns out it's a pretty pragmatic option. It's a quick subway trip into the city or out to the airport and the hostel itself is spectacularly well setup and organized. Total hipster vibe and perhaps more suited to Williamsburg but hey, it's New York. Hostel setup includes a bar and decent conversation downstairs and a gorgeous view upstairs on the rooftop terrace.</p>

					<p>Forecast was for thunderstorms later in the week so we quickly charged the camera and lined up the outdoor activities including <a href="http://www.nps.gov/elis/index.htm">Ellis Island</a>, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm">Liberty Island</a> and Central Park. In between I recommend to anyone to go through the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/en">The Met</a> described to me as the <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/en">Louvre</a> of America. Not sure how accurate that would be but I did find the Met amazingly thorough and the collections were magnificent. Easily lost a day in there even with skipped galleries. Like Coachella, you have to be harsh with what you choose to see.</p>

					<p>Getting around New York was a piece of cake thanks to a <a href="http://web.mta.info/metrocard/mcgtreng.htm#7day">$30/7-day unlimited travel pass</a>. As the hostel was in Queens, we used the subway to get into Manhattan, down the ferries, up to central park and across town to Brooklyn and Williamsburg.</p>

					<p>A night tour to the <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/">Empire State Building</a> capped off the trip. According to suggestions the line for the trip up can last up to several hours during the day so we figured an evening shot of NYC would be just as beautiful. At about this stage our luck with the weather gods on this trip ran out, we continued to have rain for pretty much the reminder of the trip in the States.</p>
