<h1>Drinks</h1>

<p>Drinks from my US, UK, Europe 2014 trip (well as many as I could remember to take). Destined for the animated version which is <a href="http://gfycat.com/KlutzyBleakBabirusa
">here</a>. Hat to to Deirdreï»¿ for the idea behind this one.</p>

<p>How did I do this? photos from iPhone into iPhoto and Exported at 180x240 (roughly enough to see everything without being massive) then
run through ImageOptim to compress them down. Then run through imagemagick.

<p>Lots of blurry shots, partly my fault as I have a shakey hand but also dropped the quality of the images so that the animation came out at a reasonable size.</p>

<p>In summary, two favorite places to drink - Dublin and Budapest.</p>

<p>Don't judge the vast amounts of Budweiser. When in rome, do as the romans do.</p>
